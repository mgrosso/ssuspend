== About ==

ssuspend is a small c program that locks /sys/power/state, removes zero or more
kernel modules, echoes a suspend mode into /sys/power/state, and then sleeps 30
or so seconds before unlocking that file.  Because it will not wait for the
lock but exit immediately if it cant acquire that lock exclusively, it is safe
to use from window managers where a keyboard shortcut keypress held down too
long or some other race condition might lead to the program being called
multiple times quickly in succession.  Because it is a small program written 
carefully in c, it is fairly safe to make setuid or add to /etc/sudoers.


== Installation ==

=== Configure and Build ===
ssuspend uses GNU autoconf, so it is configured and built
with the standard sequence:
{{{

	./configure
	make
}}}

To install type "make install" or simply copy the executable
"src/ssuspend" to a suitable directory.

=== Using with Fvwm ===

I personally use this with fvwm using the following lines...

{{{
AddToFunc Suspend       "I" Exec exec sudo /usr/local/sbin/ssuspend -x iwl3945
}}}
and 
{{{
Key End     A   MC  Suspend
}}}

so that the laptop sleeps whenever alt-control-end is pressed.

=== Using with acpid ===

I also use the following /etc/acpi/default.sh which will suspend the computer
whenever I hit the power button or the battery gets too low.

this is also in doc/default.sh. I would read it before copying it to /etc/acpi/default.sh 
to make sure you dont lose some other functionality specific to your own distribution
that isn't in this one.

== OPTIONS ==

{{{
$ ./src/ssuspend -h
ssuspend [options] [module [ module ... ] ]

   each module argument found in /proc/modules is removed in order on the way down, and restored 
       in reverse order on the way back up.

   options are as follows:    -h  or -? or --help                 get this message
    -f  <file> or --file <file>         where to write the new state. defaults to /sys/power/state.
    -s  <state> or --state <state>      what state to write to the control file. defaults to 'disk'.
    -t  <seconds> or --time <seconds>   how many seconds to sleep after resume while holding the lock.
                                        This option defaults to 30 in order to prevent extra keypress 
                                        events from causing double suspends where your laptop resumes 
                                        only to suspend again immediately.
    -x  or --lock-x                     tells ssuspend to lock the screen before suspending
    -X  or --lock-x-nofail              tells ssuspend to lock the screen before suspending if possible, 
                                        but continue in any case.
    -l  or --syslog                     TODO: tells ssuspend to write status information to syslog(3).
    -v  or --verbose                    TODO: tells ssuspend to write status information to standard error.
