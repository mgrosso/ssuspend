ssuspend version 0.1.0

ssuspend is a small c program that locks /sys/power/state, removes zero or more
kernel modules, echoes a suspend mode into /sys/power/state, and then sleeps 30
or so seconds before unlocking that file.  Because it will not wait for the
lock but exit immediately if it cant acquire that lock exclusively, it is safe
to use from window managers where a keyboard shortcut keypress held down too
long or some other race condition might lead to the program being called
multiple times quickly in succession.  Because it is written in c, it is fairly 
safe to make setuid or add to /etc/sudoers.

Each command line argument is currently interpreted as a module to remove and
restore.  subsequent versions will make all strings and numeric constants 
configurable, and add syslogging.


INSTALLATION
============

ssuspend uses GNU autoconf, so it is configured and built
with the standard sequence:

	./configure
	make

To install type "make install" or simply copy the executable
"src/ssuspend" to a suitable directory.

I personally use this with fvwm using the following lines...

AddToFunc Suspend       "I" Exec exec sudo /usr/local/sbin/ssuspend

and 

Key End     A   MC  Suspend

so that the laptop sleeps whenever alt-control-end is pressed.
